# Integration testing
There are tasks to learn covering with integration tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Integration tests are written for your processor
- Spring Boot integration tests component is reused
- Kafka is run via testcontainers library (with Docker)
- ApplicationContextInitializer and TestExecutionListener class are reused for defining DockerContainers
- @ContextConfiguration and @TestExecutionListeners annotation are reused.
- Extra producer and consumer layers are removed if they exist
